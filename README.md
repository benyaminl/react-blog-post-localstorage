## How to Init Project

Install on Dependency 

```npm install```

Then run the babel for development purpose (using react-app/dev)

```npm run watch```

For all script that's used/written, see https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-jsx-to-a-project and https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#run-jsx-preprocessor

For more, see the `package.json`


## Project Type

There are two project type, one functional, the other is classing. I prefer class component rather than functional for many reason... It's simpler to group the event delegation, rather than in functional.. where all things are stateles... :/ 
For functional, it's on `src/functional` and `index-functional.html`, for classing it's the `src` and `index.html`
